        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Traveling is my all time favorite thing to do. Exploring other cultures and experiencing small differences is very interesting to me.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Web Development is something that I find great pleasure in creating. Although, in between it's nice to get some outdoor time and be with nature which is another way I like to spend my time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from that, spending time with my girlfriend is my ideal way to relax and enjoy life.   </p>
